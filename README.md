## ‚ö° About Me

I'm a chaos-curious coder, speedcuber, and all-around tech tinkerer. Whether I'm simulating Rubik‚Äôs Cube solves in Python or 3D printing a magnetic maglev cube that won't explode on the first turn, I live for weird side projects and experiments that bend the rules (and sometimes reality).

üß† I build things like:
- üîÅ USB-portable Python tools with zero dependencies  
- üßä Rubik‚Äôs Cube simulators and analytics (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL)  
- üåê Flask-based dashboards & custom web utilities  
- üß™ Experimental scripts, generators, and absurd `RetCon()` logic bombs  

I like to **break things to understand them**, **automate what shouldn't be automated**, and **code with just enough chaos to make it interesting**.
