### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jacob.
I code
My teacher asked me if i have applied for a private scholarship yesterday
And I should probably do my homework now
This is turning into a poem
so one more thing before i go
C++
C#
C
you can all go fuck off
I like my programming languages like i like my woman
Simple, and don't tell lies.
> In all seriousness, I make some relly cool stuff that may actually have an impact in your day to day life!
> Pull requests are cool, and merging them is even cooler.
