### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Jacob. <br>
I code <br>
My teacher asked me if i have applied for a private scholarship yesterday <br>
And I should probably do my homework now <br>
This is turning into a poem <br>
so one more thing before i go <br>
C++ <br>
C# <br>
C <br>
you can all go fuck off <br>
I like my programming languages like i like my women <br>
Simple, and don't tell lies. <br>
> In all seriousness, I make some relly cool stuff that may actually have an impact in your day to day life! <br>
> Pull requests are cool, and merging them is even cooler.
